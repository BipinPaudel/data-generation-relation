The high confidence score reflects the clear causal relationship between the two entities in this context. The score is not perfect because there could be other factors involved in the formation of a clot, but the direct relationship between blood and clot production is well-established. The fact that this is a human context also supports the use of this relationship, as clots are a common response to injury in humans. The relationship is explicitly stated in the text, which further increases the confidence score."

This implies that the coma is the effect of actions taken on the patient, specifically the administration of drugs.
