cyanobacteria	produces	starch	these results indicate that starch-producing cyanobacteria have both type-i be (be3) and type-ii bes (be1 and be2) in terms of chain-length preferences, as is the case of plants.
nitrogenase	part of	cyanobacteria	the vnf genes show a similar pattern of transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of expression suggesting that the complex pattern of regulation of the nif1 cluster is conserved in other cyanobacterial nitrogenase gene clusters.
dehydration	cause	diarrhea	normally, after virechanakarma, patient does not complain of having any untoward like those present after diarrhea due to dehydration.
diarrhea	coexists with	smoker	steady-state trough plasma concentrations and incidence of rash and diarrhea in smokers at 300 mg were similar to those in former or never smokers receiving 150 mg in previous studies.
water	predisposes	giardiasis	using multivariate analysis, significant risk factors for giardiasis were children of age 5-9 years, households with > or = 3 children under the age of 12 years, low parental educational level, drinking bottled water, and living in close contact with dogs.
diarrhea	coexists with	cronkhite-canada syndrome	background and aims: cronkhite-canada syndrome (ccs) is a noninherited condition, associated with high morbidity, and characterized by gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis, alopecia, onychodystrophy, hyperpigmentation, and diarrhea.
diarrhea	occurs	hospitalized patients	diarrhea that occurs in hospitalized patients is frequent and may be due to infectious or noninfectious causes.
rrna gene	cause	diarrhea	molecular characterization of bovine cryptosporidiosis has been carried out by pcr-rflp analysis of ssu rrna gene and results indicated that cryptosporidium parvum mainly responsible for diarrhea in bovine in india.
activated charcoal	treats	diarrhea	conclusions: the result clearly demonstrated the ability of neo/bac, str/pen, and tj-14, less but significant ability of activated charcoal, to ameliorate cpt-11-induced delayed-onset diarrhea, suggesting the treatments decreasing the exposure of the intestines to the luminal sn-38 are valuable for improvement of cpt-11-induced intestinal toxicity.
cyanobacteria	location of	cellulose	this study presents the first in vitro characterization of a cyanobacterial ugpase, and provides insights into biotechnological attempts to utilize the photosynthetic production of cellulose from cyanobacteria.
cyanobacteria	location of	iron	it has been suggested that iron is a limiting factor on bloom-forming cyanobacteria in lake water.
signal transduction pathways	process of	cyanobacteria	some problems in characterizing cyanobacterial signal transduction pathways are outlined and alternative experimental strategies are discussed.
endosulfan	treats	cyanobacteria	endosulfan induced biochemical changes in nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.
diarrhea	process of	daughter	a family of four on a disabled sailboat 900 miles off the coast of mexico sent out a distress call because their 1-year-old daughter became severely ill with fever and diarrhea.
transcription factor	interacts with	cyanobacteria	cyanobacterial regulation of gene expression must contend with a genome organization that lacks apparent functional context, as the majority of cellular processes and metabolic pathways are encoded by genes found at disparate locations across the genome and relatively few transcription factors exist.
cpt-11	treats	diarrhea	the results showed that the obtained micelles could decrease the biliary excretion of cpt-11, ameliorate delayed diarrhea and intestinal toxicity of rats through inhibiting bcrp-mediated cpt-11 efflux.
diarrhea	process of	airline pilot	[unclear exanthema and recurrent diarrhea in an airline pilot].
trichomes	part of	cyanobacteria	the presence of rotifers feeding on cyanobacterial mucilage led to the decreased effectiveness of the defence in two ways, by increasing the dispersion of cyanobacterial trichomes, thus loosening the cyanobacterial mat, and through the ingestion of the exopolysaccharide material covering the trichomes.
lansoprazole	affects	diarrhea	diarrhea associated with lansoprazole.
diarrhea	associated with	disease	[nosological classification of diseases of the small and large intestine, associated with diarrhea, based on the correlation of the clinical, radiological, morphological and functional findings].
diarrhea	associated with	capillary leak syndrome	side effects included fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and major weight gain presumedly related to a capillary leak syndrome.
microcystis aeruginosa	interacts with	cyanobacterium	extracellular polymeric substances (eps) are key components of the cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa and play an important role in cyanobacteria blooms formation.
rotateq	prevents	diarrhea	compared to placebo, rotarix and rotateq were both effective at reducing rotavirus diarrhea (severe cases and cases of any severity).
