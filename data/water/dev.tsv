bacterial cell	interacts with	cyanobacteria	the bacterial cells were further characterised using specific probes for cyanobacteria, and alpha-, beta-and gamma-proteobacteria.
cyanobacteria	location of	fatty aldehyde	fatty aldehydes in cyanobacteria are a metabolically flexible precursor for a diversity of biofuel products.
microcystis aeruginosa	produces	microcystin	microcystis aeruginosa, as a typical alga, produces microcystin with strong liver toxicity, seriously endangering the liver health of human and animals.
cyanobacteria	location of	chlorophyllide	light-dependent nadph:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (por), a nuclear-encoded plastid-localized enzyme, catalyzes the photoreduction of protochlorophyllide (pchlide) to chlorophyllide in higher plants, algae and cyanobacteria.
fingolimod	treats	diarrhea	conclusion: physicians should be aware of this association and screen for cryptosporidium in cases of diarrhea in patients treated with fingolimod.
captopril	associated with	diarrhea	captopril in congenital chloride diarrhea: a case study.
ethanol	treats	cyanobacteria	to improve ethanol production directly from co2 in photosynthetic cyanobacterial systems, one key issue that needs to be addressed is the low ethanol tolerance of cyanobacterial cells.
diarrhea	is a	complication	this technique is free of complications such as diarrhea, infection, and peptic ulceration that are seen in other biliary diversion models, and it is tolerated well by the animals.
diarrhea	coexists with	inflammatory bowel disease	in any patient presenting with diarrhea, the presence of cl difficile toxin may obscure the presence of underlying inflammatory bowel disease.
dysentery	type of	gastrointestinal disease	gastrointestinal diseases, such as typhoid, cholera, and amebic dysentery can be brought into these countries through workers returning from endemic regions, and also through refugees from conflict-torn neighboring countries.
anabaena sphaerica	is a	cyanobacterium	purification and properties of a flavodoxin from the heterocystous cyanobacterium anabaena sphaerica.
diarrhea	cause	hospital admission	the synergism between nutrition status and hospital admissions due to diarrhea and pneumonia was studied in a population-based birth cohort of greater than 5000 children in southern brazil.
right iliac fossa	location of	diarrhea	amoebic perforation of the bowel should be suspected in patients presenting with an acute abdomen if a past history of fever, pain and diarrhea is obtained, particularly if a large tender mass is present in the right iliac fossa.
photosensitivity	associated with	cyanobacteria	the symbiont hypothesis, which i call the russian doll model, assumes that photosensitivity arose first in photosynthetic cyanobacteria that were subsequently taken up into red algae as primary chloroplasts.
diarrhea	associated with	chronic proctitis	[diarrhea in chronic proctitis due to artefact].
antigen	associated with	diarrhea	however, asymptomatic colonization with rotavirus is very common in early infancy, and demonstration of the antigen correlates with a causative role in diarrhea in only about one half of cases.
